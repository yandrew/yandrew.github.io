        <div><p class="heading">Driver vs Navigator</p>
            <p>Driver: Mainly the person that types the code. They focus on the current state of the code.
            </p>
            <p>Navigator: They look at the bigger picture of the code.
                The navigator plans direction the code and driver will go.

                Reflection
            </p>
            <p>It was our 4th pairing and second time pairing together. Things went pretty smoothly between us. From the start, we already knew how both worked. We both had similar
                level of skill in HTML/ CSS. We both filled each other gaps of knowledge at times. We ran into a problem of position. We talked through the problem thoroughly and eventually solved it together.
