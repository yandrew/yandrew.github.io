        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have paired with many other people to solve challenges in the past couple weeks. It's comforting to have someone to share your thoughts about the challenge. It's good to have someone else checking your work and looking for mistakes. You end up helping each other out. I believe that as long as both partners are not conflicting, it's very beneficial to pair with someone on a problem. By talking though a problem, you help yourself to memorize the subjects learned. <br><br> 

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the most part, my pairing sessions went smoothly. You sometimes have to compromise about which method to use when solving challenges with someone else. Sometimes the sessions were a bit one-sided. I had one pairing partner that took control over everything. He was navigating and driving at the same time. This was a little frustrating for me becuase I didn't feel like I was contributing enough.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sometimes felt proud of myself if it was a postive feedback. I also felt some shame when it was negative feedback. I take the feedback as a way to guage myself and to discover things I need to improve. Next time I pair, I'm going to work on overall communication. I need to let my pairing partner know when I'm going to research a topic and let them know specifically what I'm researching.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel pairing and and feedback can really help me in my learning process. While pairing, you get to test yourself and expand your knowledge at the same time. Feedback lets me know whats wrong so that I can improve my future pairing sessions. Effective pairing is both beneficial for me and my partner. It just makes learning that much more fluent. It's not only a useful tool now but also in the future working in the industry.
