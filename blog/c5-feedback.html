        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We paired with many other people to solve challenges this week. It's comforting to have someone to talk out your thoughts about the challenge. It's good to have someone else checking your work and looking for mistakes. You end up helping each other out. I believe that as long as both partners are not conflicting, it's very beneficial to pair with someone on a problem. By talking though a problem you help yourself to memorize the subjects learned. <br><br> 

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the most part, my pairing session went smoothly. You do have to compromise with which method to use when solving challenges with someone else. Sometimes the sessions were a bit one one sided. I had one pairing partner that took control over everything. He was navigating and driving at the same time. This was a little frustrating for me becuase I didn't feel like I was contributing enough.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sometimes felt proud of myself if it was a postive feedback. I also felt some shame when it was negative feedback. I take the feedback as a way to guage myself and to discover things I need to improve.
