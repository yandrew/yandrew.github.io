        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I value close relationships in my life. I feel that it's important to have close friends that you can rely on in life. I feel having a few close relationships are much better than having a lot of friends that are not as close. By having close relationships, you can trust them and you know they'll always be there for you when you need a hand or support in times of need.  <br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I take a look at the values in my life, I feel joy, excitement, and gratitude. 
        I think recognizing your feeling are important to controlling your feelings. Knowing your feelings of stereotype threat will help to mediate it. If I'm feeling down during at my time at DBC, I could talk to my close friends to get a another perspective of the situation. I know my close friends usually try to cheer me up. I could also take a break and maybe try to enjoy nature, like a walk, to help calm myself down and reset state of mind. I could say the accomplishments I've already acheived to make it known to myself. I've also heard it's helpful to say 3 positive things in your life you're glad to have each day to help you from feeling down.
