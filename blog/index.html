            I can't believe we're already finished with the first 3 weeks of the prep work. It seems it just went by really quickly. I felt I've learned a lot in these past 3 weeks. I've realized I've also learned a lot about myself. This program really makes us reflect a lot especially after each week. Not only does this reaffirm what I've learned through this process, but also learn about the way we feel and react to certain learning situations.</p>
        <p class="content">In the first week I took a quiz about my Gregorc Thinking style. I got a tie between Abstract Sequential and Concrete Random. This covers a lot of the spectrum and I think a little of both describes my thinking styles...<span  class="link-readmore">

            So what is an array or a hash? Sounds like a Star Trek weapon and some breakfast food. They are both objects in the programming world, specifically in the language Ruby. Both have their own uses. Let's say you're a planning a party and you wanted to keep track of guest list. How would you be able to do this in a program? It might be helpful to make a list. <span  class="link-readmore">

            In HTML / CSS there are elements can be tagged with a specific ID or Class name. IDs are unique and are only supposed to be declared on one element in a document. Classes are not unique. A specific class can be used on more than one element. Also each element can also have more than one class. Let's say you had a list of items each in a "li" tag (which lists them out in bulletpoint form) and you placed each one in a class...<span  class="link-readmore">

        <p id="content"><!-- insert post here -->I'm pretty excited to start DBC. I think that DBC is a great new way to prepare you for a career. I think that traditional colleges do a poor job doing this. DBC gives you real world problems and you're set in an environment similar to the work setting.  I believe DBC teaches you the tools to learn a programming language in a short amount of time. Buts it's not just about learning the language, it's more everything else that goes into being a great developer including soft skills. I think that the fast paced environment, where all the students are just as enthusiastic as me about learning the material, will just push me even harder to excel.

          I just started week 1 of Phase 0 with DevBootcamp. I've actually learned quite a lot. I used to be confused about how GitHub worked but now it's very clear to me. Here's what I've learned so far.

        <p id="content">  Version Control is a pretty much an essential tool to programmers. Version control is a way to keep track of changes you make as you write your program or edit your files. Let's say you've added some code to a program and when you try to run the program, it crashes. Good thing you've got Version Control. You can now go back to the previously saved version and undo your mistakes. You can think of it like a video game. You wouldn't want to play through the whole video game without making any game saves. Well I think I did have a friend play a Final Fantasy game without a memory card; he would leave his ps2 on all day and night so he wouldn't lose his place in the game...
