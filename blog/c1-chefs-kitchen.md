##DBC Thoughts

November 1, 2014

I’m pretty excited to start DBC. I think that DBC is a great new way to prepare you for a career. I think that traditional colleges do a poor job doing this. DBC gives you real world problems and you’re set in an environment similar to the work setting.  I believe DBC teaches you the tools to learn a programming language in a short amount of time. Buts it’s not just about learning the language, it’s more everything else that goes into being a great developer including soft skills. I think that the fast paced environment, where all the students are just as enthusiastic as me about learning the material, will just push me even harder to excel. 

It’s pretty interesting in how DBC started. It’s kinda surprising how no one has thought of teaching like this before. I think it’s very important to have constant curriculum revisions when teach anything technology related. Technology changes all the time and so does teaching material. 

I have realized that each cohort’s outcomes are different. It’s really up to us and what we make of our time there at the program. This is the kitchen mindset that Shereef was talking about. I feel that if we all encourage each other and help each other out it will only benefit all of us in the end. I agree with Shereef in that many do people feel that they’re entitled to things these days. This kind of attitude is what slows down the class as a whole. 

I’m looking forward the first day of the program and really get my feet wet. I don’t really feel nervous about starting the program because we’re all coming from different backgrounds and all starting at pretty much the same level. We are going to learn together. Knowing that you have many other students to help you out is also reassuring.
