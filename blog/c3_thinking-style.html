        <h5>DBC Phase 0 Week #3</h5>
        <p><!-- date -->November 15, 2014</p>
        <p class="content">I can't believe we're already finished with the first 3 weeks of the prep work. It seems it just went by really quickly. I felt I've learned a lot in these past 3 weeks. I've realized I've also learned a lot about myself. This program really makes us reflect a lot especially after each week. Not only does this reaffirm what I've learned through this process, but also learn about the way we feel and react to certain learning situations.</p>
        <p class="content">In the first week I took a quiz about my Gregorc Thinking style. I got a tie between Abstract Sequential and Concrete Random. This covers a lot of the spectrum and I think a little of both describes my thinking styles.</p>
        <p class="content">The part of Abstract Sequential that describes me is I like to analyze situations and I like to apply logic in solving problems. They have trouble with "sentimental" thinking and expressing their emotions, which is very true for me.</p>
        <p class="content">Concrete Random thinkers like to do trial and error to solve problems. They like to take risks and they like to be independent. They like to be competitive and they don't like rules or restrictions. They don't like working in groups.  I feel this describes me too.</p>
        <p class="content">I'm a little of both. I can leverage these thinking styles to benefit me in DBC. I like to be in a stimulating environment where everyone is enthusiastic about the same things. This is very beneficial to me at DBC because everyone is just as passionate as I am about programming. I must use the surround resources and experts to help me learn. When I'm stuck on a problem or challenge, I can take a step back and analyze the situation before acting. I sometimes tend to just dive into trial and error too quickly. I have to be keener on expressing my emotions and not let it bunch up inside me. Pair programming is good for me because I'm bad at showing how I got an answer. It'll force me to think over what I actually did when solving a problem and to talk it over with somebody. Overall, I just have to be more organized and set aside blocks of time to work on certain projects or subjects.</p>
        <p class="content">So far in Phase 0, the only struggle I've had is learning the css position and also sometimes figuring out what to write in the reflections or blogs. I think the more I write the blogs, the more natural it becomes for me to get my thoughts out on the keyboard. I find that pairing has helped me a lot. Even though I prefer to work by myself, I'm getting more comfortable working collaboratively.</p>
        <p class="content">I'm always striving in having a growth mindset vs. having a fixed mindset. This means that view that you have to work for intelligence vs. having a static intelligence. In order to achieve this, I need shape some of my learning and thinking styles. I need to view this program as a end to a means. It's a journey and an experience that I can benefit from. It's like a set of tools for the future or learning. If I run into obstacles, I need to take a step back and reassess the problem instead of just giving up. In everything there is a lesson to be learned, even in failure. I know I'm afraid of failure and so are most people. I need to embrace it and tackle the challenges one by one at a time. Feedback seems to be an important theme in this program. I can't be afraid of criticism and instead use it as a tool for becoming better. These are some ways that I can work my way towards having a growth mindset.</p>
