I can't believe we're already finished with the first 3 weeks of the prep work. It seems it just went by really quickly. I felt I've learned a lot in these past 3 weeks. I've realized I've also learned a lot about myself. This program really makes us reflect a lot especially after each week. Not only does this reaffirm what I've learned through this process, but also learn about the way we feel and react to certain learning situations. 

In the first week I took a quiz about my Gregorc Thinking style. I got a tie between Abstract Sequential and Concrete Random. This covers a lot of the spectrum and I think a little of both describes my thinking styles. 

The part of Abstract Sequential that describes me is I like to analyze situations and I like to apply logic in solving problems. They have trouble with "sentimental" thinking and expressing their emotions which is very true for me. 

Concrete Random thinkers like to do trial and error to solve problems. They like to take risks and they like to be independent. They like to be competitive and they don't like rules or restrictions. They don't like working in groups.  I feel this describes me too. 

I'm a little of both. I can leverage these thinking styles to benefit me in DBC. I like to be in a stimulating environment where everyone is enthusiastic about the same things. This is very beneficial to me at DBC because everyone is just as passionate as I am about programming. I must use the surround resources and experts to help me learn. When I'm stuck on a problem or challenge, I can take a step back and analyze the situation before acting. I sometimes tend to just dive into trial and error too quickly. I have to be more keen on expressing my emotions and not let it bunch up inside me. Pair programming is good for me because I'm bad at showing how I got an answer. It'll force me to think over what I actually did when solving a problem and to talk it over with somebody. Overall, I just have to be more organized and set aside blocks of time to work on certain projects or subjects. 

So far in Phase 0, the only stuggle I've had is learning the css position and also sometimes figuring out what to write in the reflections or blogs. I think the more I write the blogs, the more natural it becomes for me to get my thoughts out on the keyboard. I find that pairing has helped me a lot. Even though I prefer to work by myself, I'm getting more comfortable working collaboratively.
